### COUNTER MADNESS!!!

- Redo the counter 
- A bunch of counters.
- Change their colors: background, front, font size
- Make them in column layout
- Make them in row layout
- Make them in square layout

- Let them set the increment
- Let them auto increment
- Let them skip numbers (all/odd/none)
- Style them with colours, etc.
- Allow to add new counters.
- Have a counter that changes colour, font size, if count is odd/even, %10, etc
- Have a counter with random styles
