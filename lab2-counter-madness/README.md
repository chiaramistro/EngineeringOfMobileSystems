### COUNTER MADNESS!!!

The goal of this lab is to practice base React and RN skills. In particular, we will practice:
- definition of components
- basic UI components 
- setState
- layout and styling of components
- component lifecycle

To get started, you should go to [https://snack.expo.io]. You can select any rendering you want (Android, iOS, Web), although it's probably quicker to just pick the web rendering.

The first thing you will do is to re-implement both counter we did (the one with increment and decrement buttons, and the auto-incrementing one) in React Native. After that, it's up to you! Here are some things you can do, try to do as many as possible.

- A bunch of counters.
- Change their colors: background, front, font size
- Make them in column layout
- Make them in row layout
- Make them in square layout

- Let them set the increment
- Let them auto increment
- Let them skip numbers (all/odd/none)
- Make auto-increment go faster/slower
- Style them with colours, etc.
- Allow to add new counters.
- Have a counter that changes colour, font size, if count is odd/even, %10, etc
- Have a counter with random styles
- Have counter that move around the grid
- Sort the counters by their count
